\section{Left/Right Footprint Detection}

(TODO - describe the task if there's time and space)

\subsection{Image Preprocessing}
\subsubsection{Motivation}
The 5000 training images for left and right footprints were always bounded by a rectangle of Gaussian noise and came in a variety of orientations and crops. The flexibility and expressivity of neural networks as a series of many nonlinear functions can both be its greatest strength but also its greatest weakness. While the object in this problem is to learn what left and right footprints look like respectively, a neural network may actually end up learning other additional things if trained on the raw data. For example, it might notice that left feet are more prone to be vertically oriented while right feet are more prone to be horizontally oriented, which is an artifact of our particular dataset. Therefore, all the training images and testing images were preprocessed in the following manner.

\subsection{Method}
All images were affected by Gaussian noise, first a mask of the foot print track (area within the parallel line boundary between the footprint and surrounding noise and white background) was created. This was done by blurring the image with two median filters (of size 5 x 5 then 10 x 10) and finding all the pixels below the pixel brightness of 255 (which extracted the white background). A median filter was used to maintain as much of the sharp edge between the footprint track and the white background as possible. Using a simple averaging Gaussian filter would have allowed outliers to affect the result of the filter more strongly (if most of the pixels in the filter bounding box were white background but a few were black, the result of the filter be pulled to below 255 where a median filter would generate a 255 result and include it outside of the footprint track region of the mask (TODO - reword)).

Then the edge of the mask were located using a Sobel filter, which combines the result from horizontal and vertical derivative operations which give rise to horizontal and vertical edges respectively. The longest edge was then found using MATLAB's function for finding connected components in an image, which always corresponded to the edges of the track what paralleled the sides of the footprint. The image was then rotated using the angle between that edge and the y axis of the image to get it in a vertical position. (While this method for orienting the images wasn't perfect and it left the ambiguity of the foot pointing upward or downward, the neural network was able to determine the determine the difference between the left and right feet reasonably well even still).

The final steps of the preprocessing step involved cropping the iamge to only include the footprint track (without the background) and resizing the image to feed into the neural network. Though the average imension of the training images was found to be 470 x 230, the final preprocessed image size was reduced to 235 x 115 due to GPU memory constraints.

(TODO - show series of preprocessing steps)

\subsection{Learning algorithm}

\subsubsection{Library used}
Keras with Tensorflow was selected due to its simple front-end interface and very powerful backend for building and training neural networks. Though it turns out that it is possible to achieve very decent accuracy with training a kernalized SVM with a RBF kernel with PCA features (95\%), I made the personal choice to go with a neural network to gain hands on experience with deep learning through this project.

\subsection{Network Architecture}
For the simple left/right classification, the original MNIST architecture was trained from scratch on the training data. The rationale for starting off with this architecture was that recent, more popular but complex networks for Imagenet like Alexnet designed to do 1000 way classification would be must too large and be very likely to overfit.

In the first few attempts of training, it was found that the training and validation accuracies were stuck at 69\% and 50\% respectively regardless of the various changes made, such as trying Alexnet architecture, adding additional layers, etc. It turned out that although the Adagrad weight update method is often preferred over Adadelta due to its greater robustness to intial learning rate and often faster convergence (albeit at a poorer local minima), Adagrad performs very poorly on this dataset. As many others have found, Adagrad does better than Adagrad in a saddle point (TODO - ref) but Adadelta performs better at an error manifold that resembles the Beale's function (the large initial gradient makes Adagrad almost go unstable) and in the long valley (Adadelta breaks the symmetry and descends much faster). Though the figures only represent canonical 2D error manifolds, it still gives some insight as to how the various weight optimizers behave. The error manifold was probably ridden with very many local minima that the more conservative Adagrad approach could not escape out of. 

(TODO - put in images from imgur and cite Alec Radford)

With a more suitable weight optimizer, the final architecture was taken to as follows in Figure (TODO - cite). It took the original MNIST architecture and added two back to back convolution layers after the max pooling layer, which is a common paradigm used in many Imagenet architectures like Alexnet and VGG.

\section{Footprint Matching}

(TODO - describe the task if there's time and space)

\subsection{Image Preprocessing}

Image preprocessing of the training and testing images were necessary due to significant disparty between the two. While the original training images were always correctly oriented and the footprints very clear with no noise, the testing images were peppered with Gaussian noise and oriented in an arbitrary orientation. And while the testing images could either be of the left or right foot, the training images were always a right footprint.

Using ImageDataGenerator class of Python's Keras library, each training image was resized into a standard size for training with neural network. The same class was also used to create 20 additional images of a random orientation between 0 and 360 degrees with a random horizontal flip to allow them to be left or right foot. The total training size increased from 1,000 images to 20,000 images.

The Gaussian noise from the test images were removed and the remaining foot print was made into a binary image to mimic the clean images training images. 

(TODO - insert sample training and testing images here)

\subsection{Architecture and Methods}

As Figure (TODO - cite) from Eugenio Culurciello demonstrates, the Inception v3 architecture was used as it seemed to be a good compromise between accuracy and parameters. Three different training methods were tried.

(TODO - insert diagram)

\subsubsection{Training from Scratch}

The first method attempted trained the Inception architecture from scratch, under the rationale that the Imagenet weights would have learned to differentiate color in the RGB Imagenet images. The training data was split into a 70/30 train/validation split, which was carefully done so that the training and validation distributions were the same. This meant that 70\% of the augmented images for each of the 1000 classes were used for training and 30\% of the augmented images for validation, as opposed to a random 70/30 split of the entire 20,000 image dataset. However, after training for 12 epochs, the many of the 10,000 test predictions consisted of only a subset of the training images (for example, training image 812 would repeated by be predicted eight times in a row).

This led to the hypothesis that the network was not expressive or deep enough.

\subsubsection{Additional Layers}

The next method involved inserting a couple dense layers at the top of the network to increase the network's ability to learn. The training and validation results improved (achieving 95\% and 92\%) respectively, but it did poorly on test data, only achieving 0.1\% which corresponds to a random guess. So now it looked like the network was overfitting.

This was the test data was proprocessed to remove Gaussian noise and have binary footprint images, which brough up the test accuracy to 0.2\%. In order to try and prevent overfitting, transfer learning was tried next.

\subsubsection{Transfer Learning}

The original Inception v3 architecture was used but now loaded with pretrained Imagenet weights. The first layer was changed however to accomodate grayscale images. The input images were resized to be 224 x 224 to mimic the original Imagenet images.

This new network was trained for 6 epochs and achieved extremely good training and validation accuracies but failed to achieve a high test accuracy, indicating overfitting once again.

\subsection{Considerations}

In the end, the highest achieved test accuracy was 0.2\% with an Inception V3 base architecture trained from scratch with additional dense layers placed at the end.

Some additional techniques that would've been worthwhile to try include

\begin{itemize}
\item further preprocessing the images to get rid of some the solid black lines and rulers at the periphery of the image.
\item orienting the test images vertically so it's not left to chance that one of the 20 augmentations would be at the exact orientation as the one arbitrarily oriented test image
\end{itemize}

\section{Submission of papers to NIPS 2016}

\textbf{There is a new style file for papers submitted in 2016!}

NIPS requires electronic submissions.  The electronic submission site
is
\begin{center}
  \url{https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/NIPS2016/}
\end{center}

Please read carefully the instructions below and follow them
faithfully.

\subsection{Style}

Papers to be submitted to NIPS 2016 must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to eight pages
long, including figures. Since 2009 an additional ninth page
\emph{containing only acknowledgments and/or cited references} is
allowed. Papers that exceed nine pages will not be reviewed, or in any
other way considered for presentation at the conference.

The margins in 2016 are the same as since 2007, which allow for
$\sim$$15\%$ more words in the paper compared to earlier years.

Authors are required to use the NIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable
at the NIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the
current files and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may
be grounds for rejection.

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}

The style files for NIPS and other conference information are
available on the World Wide Web at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://www.nips.cc/}
\end{center}
The file \verb+nips_2016.pdf+ contains these instructions and
illustrates the various formatting requirements your NIPS paper must
satisfy.

The only supported style file for NIPS 2016 is \verb+nips_2016.sty+,
rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{}
  2.09, Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}

The new \LaTeX{} style file contains two optional arguments:
\verb+final+, which creates a camera-ready copy, and \verb+nonatbib+,
which will not load the \verb+natbib+ package for you in case of
package clash.

At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ option. This will
anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid review.  Please
do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they will
be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.

The file \verb+nips_2016.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing
your paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract,
and text of the paper with your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are
summarized in Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and
\ref{others} below.

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas)
wide and 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch
(9~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing (leading) of
11~points.  Times New Roman is the preferred typeface throughout, and
will be selected for you by default.  Paragraphs are separated by
\nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no indentation.

The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold,
centered between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points
thick and the bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow
\nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and below the title to rules. All
pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each
name is centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's
name is to be listed first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if
different address) are set to follow. If there is only one co-author,
list both author and co-author side by side.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper
nouns), flush left, and bold.

First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\paragraph{Paragraphs}

There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the
heading in bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the
heading followed by 1\,em of space.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.
Citations may be author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain
internal consistency.  As to the format of the references themselves,
any style is acceptable as long as it is used consistently.

The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations
appropriate for use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}

If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may
add the following before loading the \verb+nips_2016+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}

If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add
the optional argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{nips_2016}
\end{verbatim}

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the
third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et
al.\ [4],'' not ``In our previous work [4].'' If you cite your other
papers that are not widely available (e.g., a journal paper under
review), use anonymous author names in the citation, e.g., an author
of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote,
indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
  footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the
page on which they appear.  Precede the footnote with a horizontal
rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption
always appear after the figure. Place one line space before the figure
caption and one line space after the figure. The figure caption should
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); figures are
numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure
captions and the paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in
either black/white or in color.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table
number and title always appear before the table.  See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical
  rules.} We strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package,
which allows for typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\begin{table}[t]
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule{1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style
files.  In particular, do not modify the width or length of the
rectangle the text should fit into, and do not change font sizes
(except perhaps in the \textbf{References} section; see below). Please
note that pages should be numbered.

\section{Preparing PDF files}

Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and
not, for example, ``A4.''

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file
must only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few
instructions to achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader,
  select the menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show
  All Fonts. You can also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes
  with \verb+xpdf+ and is available out-of-the-box on most Linux
  machines.

\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose
  fonts are also acceptable for NIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap
  fonts.  Use "solid" shapes instead.

\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You
  should use the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or
\verb+\mathbb{C}+ for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You
can also use the following workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the
\verb+amssymb+ package.

\end{itemize}

If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we
will ask you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always
specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the
example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly
hyphenate a line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the
\verb+\-+ command when necessary.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
acknowledgments go at the end of the paper. Do not include
acknowledgments in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper.

\section*{References}

References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level
heading for the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable
as long as you are consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font
size to \verb+small+ (9 point) when listing the references. {\bf
  Remember that you can use a ninth page as long as it contains
  \emph{only} cited references.}
